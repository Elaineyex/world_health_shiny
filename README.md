# Project Title
World Health Shiny App

## Project Description:

In this project, we created an interactive, user-friendly dashboard by leveraging data
from the Kaggle World Health Statistics 2020 (originally retrieved from the World Health Organization) to provide accurate and accessible health information to medical personnel, world health agencies, and the general public. The shiny app is published at https://casey-mae-perez.shinyapps.io/2020-World-Health-Statistics/.

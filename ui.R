gaining access to clean water and basic sanitation services. Worldwide, there is also a decreasing trend in maternal and infant mortality rates, accompanied by an increase in skilled health 
professionals density. Although the trend on world health looks promising, there are still differences between high-income areas vs. middle- and low-income areas.  Continent-wise, Europe 
tends to outperform the rest of the continents, by having the lowest incidence of communicable disease, lowest mortality rate, and the highest rate of access to professional health personnel.  
On the other hand, despite the positive trend in world health, certain countries still face health challenges. For example, countries like Afghanistan and the Philippines are currently experiencing 
a surge in HIV infections since 2000."),

However, there still exists a gap between sexes regarding health outcomes. In particular, males tend to experience a higher infant mortality rate, lower life 
expectancy, and higher HIV infections in comparison to females. Notably, such sex disparity appears to be more salient in countries with less health personnel. 
For example, in Chad, where only around 20% of the births were attended by professional health personnel, there is a larger gap in infant mortality rate between 
males and females than there is in Argentina, where the rate of births attended by professionals is around 95%. On the other hand, we acknowledge that the current 
health system could disproportionally put women and non-binary people at disadvantage. That said, the datasets we have did not collect gender identity, so we could 
not assess these important health disparities in this report.

and between countries, especially for low- and middle-income countries that have lots of health burdens. It is critical to encourage close collaborations between policymakers and researchers to adapt 
scientific findings into public health programs. In addition, health organizations around the world should continue building global and national research networks to coordinate research efforts. Finally, 
local governments should identify regions of high risk and take special measures to protect these population groups, taking into consideration their specific circumstances."),

  would ensure access to safe and readily available water and sanitation services for people within and across countries."),
p("For certain communicable diseases, making vaccines widely available around the world could help reduce the incidence of that disease and lessen the social and economic burden of the disease on the community. The government needs to place 
  an emphasis on leveraging resources and incentivizing the development and production of vaccines on a national level."),
p("Finally, the government could focus on developing educational programs to promote health literacy, such as destigmatizing mental illness and suicides, in all populations which would allow people to make appropriate health decisions."),

getting access to health service. Social determinants, such as high poverty rate, stigmatization surrounding health behaviors, and educational disparity that are associated with diminished resources, could be those barriers. Thus, it is essential 
to involve other sections, such as the education, labor, and welfare sections, in addition to promoting health service through the health section."),
